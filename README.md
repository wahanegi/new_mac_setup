## New Development Machine Install (Mac)

*NOTE:* After installing something new, if something doesn't work like you expect, try quitting and restarting terminal.
1. Install the latest version of XCode from the App store, run `$ xcode-select --install`
2. Install the latest version of Homebrew: http://brew.sh
3. Install Git on Mac using homebrew: `$ brew install git`
4. Set your GIT username from terminal: `$ git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"`
5. Set your GIT email address from terminal: `$ git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"`
6. Generate and add SSH keys your Github account by following the instructions at https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/
7. Install GPG using homebrew: `$ brew install gpg` (May be needed for RVM in next step)
8. Install the latest version of RVM: https://rvm.io, but instead of `gpg2` Use `gpg` in the command that adds the GPG keys.  If this doesn't work check out the [security](http://rvm.io/rvm/security) page for a workaround.
9. Install Ruby from terminal using RVM: `$ rvm install 3.2.4` (for AppleSilicon add ` --with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix)/opt/openssl@3`)
10. Install posgtres from terminal: `$ brew install postgresql@15` and follow its instructions to start the service using `brew services...` command + anything else it suggests.
11. Create postgresql superuser postgres: `$ createuser postgres -s`
12. Change your directory to where you want your work projects in terminal and clone the git repo: `$ git clone git@github.com:my_github_account/my_repo.git`
13. Go into the directory `$ cd my_repo`. Confirm that when you run `$ rvm gemset list` it lists "my_repo" as your gemset.
14. Run `$ gem install bundler`
15. Run `$ gem update --system`
16. Run bundler: `$ bundle`
17. Create a new database: `$ rails db:create`
18. Should be ready to roll: `$ rails s`

### Highly Recommended Mac Goodies
1. For pretty and customizable command line info, including branch and whether you have uncommited changes or not: 
   
        $ brew install zsh-git-prompt

    Then update `~/.zshrc` with the following code:
   
        source "/usr/local/opt/zsh-git-prompt/zshrc.sh"

        PROMPT='%~%b$(git_super_status)\$ '
        
        clean_branches() {
            git remote prune origin
            git branch -vv | grep "origin/.*: gone]" | awk '{print $1}' | xargs git branch -D
        }
*NOTE*: The `source "..."` might be different than what is above. Copy/paste it from the brew installation output.

2. For a fast command line way to browse the most recent git commits: `$ brew install tig`. Then run `$ tig` at the command prompt.
3. For Code Editing: [RubyMine from JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/download)

### Rubymine Support for Rubocop (Code Linting)
Code Linting gives formatting and syntax suggestions to make your code more readable.

In Rubymine go to `Rubymine` -> `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `Inspections` -> `Ruby` -> `Gems and gems management` -> `Rubocop`: Make sure that the checkbox is checked. Set the "Highlighting in editor:" settings and severities mapping for Refactor and Convention to "Warning".

## GIT

### Beginner's Guide to Changing Code

Every time you are ready to start work, do the following terminal commands in the wyzyr directory:

    $ git fetch
    $ git pull origin master
    $ bundle
    $ rails db:migrate
Then if your server isn't started yet:

 1. Tab 1: `$ rails s`
 2. Tab 2: `$ redis-server`
 3. Tab 3: `$ sidekiq -C 'config/sidekiq.yml'`


At this point you can point your browser to http://localhost:3000/ and start development work.
To stop the server click `CNTL-C` in all three tabs.

To check to make sure your code changes didn't break anything critical:

    $ rspec

Green dots are good, red F's are bad. Note that sometimes other people may have broken the build, so use your best judgement if the automated test errors were caused by your code or not (for example if you undo changes and re-run the test).

To push your code changes to the repo:

        $ git add .
        $ git commit -m "CP-XXX: Message describing what changes you made"
        $ git push origin branch_name

Note: replace XXX with the Jira story ID (very important).

Switching between master and a private branch:

        $ git checkout branch_name
        $ git checkout master

### Cherry Picking
If you need to copy over a commit from one branch to another without merging:

1. Copy the SHA of the commit you want to copy over (the program "tig" is good for this which can be installed via brew on a Mac).
2. Go to the branch you want to copy the commit to ($ git checkout [BRANCHNAME])
3. Use cherry-pick to copy over the commit:

        $ git cherry-pick [SHA]

NOTE: If you have more than one commit to copy over, do the cherry-pick commands in the same order as they were commited.
Also be careful about doing this if there is a high possibility of there being a conflict.
See https://ariejan.net/2010/06/10/cherry-picking-specific-commits-from-another-branch/

2. Manually delete any remaining files:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.rvm
   ```
3. Verify RVM is no longer available:
   ```bash
   rvm
   ```
   If the command is not found, the removal was successful.

---

### Optional: Resolving error ‚Äòruby\r‚Äô: No such file or directory

This error occurs when Windows-style carriage return (\r\n) characters are present in script files (e.g., bin/rails,
bin/dev) instead of Unix-style line endings (\n). Follow the steps below to resolve the issue:

1. **Convert Files to LF Format:**
   Ensure all files in the `bin` folder use Unix-style line endings:
   ```bash
   dos2unix bin/*
   ```
2. **Verify File Format:**
   Confirm that the files are now in the correct format:
   ```bash
   file bin/*
   ```
   You should see `ASCII text` without `CRLF`.
   ```bash
   Example:
   bin/rails: ASCII text
   bin/dev: ASCII text
   ```
3. **Check File Permissions**
   Ensure the files in the bin folder are executable:
   1. Verify the permissions for a specific file (e.g., bin/dev):
    ```bash
    ls -la bin/dev
    ```
   If the output shows no x (execution) in the permissions (e.g., -rw-r--r--), add execution permissions:
    ```bash 
    chmod +x bin/dev
    ```
   2. Alternatively, make all scripts in the bin folder executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x bin/*
    ```
4. **Restart the Script**
   Run the script again to check if the error is resolved:
   ```bash
   bin/dev
   ```

> **NOTE:** If you use RubyMine IDE, this issue can often be resolved by configuring line separators in the
> IDE: [Configure line separators in RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/objc/configuring-line-endings-and-line-separators.html)
---

### Optional Tools

1. Git Commit Browser: Install `tig`:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install tig
   ```
   Run `tig` to browse recent commits.

2. IDE Recommendation: Use [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/download) for code editing.

3. Linting: Set up RuboCop for code quality checks in RubyMine under
   `Settings > Editor > Inspections > Ruby > Gems and gems management > RuboCop`.
   Make sure that the checkbox is checked. Set the "Highlighting in editor:" settings and severities mapping for
   Refactor and Convention to "Warning"
